title: What is Jekyll Collections and how to use it?
desc: Jekyll collections is a set of items which cannot be grouped into a post or page. For example, a collection of stamps, books, cakes etc. It is very easy to create and organize multiple collections on a Jekyll blog.

## Why 'collections'?

While blogging you will realize that you have some things that do not fit into the category of posts nor into pages. Here is a comparison between the three.

### Posts:
Chronologically arranged items - generally date wise arrangement.

### Pages:
No particular arrangement or connection between individual items. For example, a **Contact** page has nothing to do with an **About** page and they can be arranged in any manner.

### Collections:
Collections is a set of items which has a certain relation between individual items but may not have a chronological arrangement.


For example, let's consider you have a blog which is about movie reviews. You write your reviews as posts. So for every movie you create a post. Let's say you want to make a list of **Top 25 must watch movies** or **Top 10 scary movies** which will have all the details of each movie. In this case, posts or pages are not a good choice to go with. We can use collections instead. It is a collection of certain kind of movies. You can have any number of collections.

A better example would be from my own blog. There is a section called [**Themes**](/themes/){:target="_blank"} in the menu bar. I have a collection of themes on that page. If I make new posts for all my themes then it wouldn't make sense. Why would anyone put themes in between tutorials? I can make pages but how many pages should I make? How should I list them? So it had to be a collection.

## Jekyll collections initial setup
Using Jekyll collections is very easy. The first thing to do is to mention your new collection in your **_config.yml** file. Let's say I want two collections in my Jekyll blog. One is **Themes** where I put all the themes I created and another one is **Designs** where I keep all my designs to show off.

This is how you define collections in _config.yml.
{% highlight yml %}
collections:
    - themes
    - designs
{% endhighlight %}

You can add more metadata if needed

{% highlight yml %}
collections:
    themes:
        output: true
        permalink: /jekyll-themes/:path/
        
    designs:
        output: true
        permalink: /my-designs/:path/
{% endhighlight %}


## Jekyll collection folders
Now at the root of the repository, create two folders(because we mentioned two collections) with the names ``_themes`` and ``_designs``. Underscore is necessary, do not leave it out.

We have to keep our collection inside these folders. Let's keep some files inside ``_themes`` folder. I have created 3 themes so far. I want them to be showed as a collection with certain details. Then I will have to showcase them as a list or a grid.

This is pretty much like how we keep all the posts inside the **_posts** folder and show them via a list on the homepage.

Here is how I have defined individual collection file

{% highlight yml %}{% raw %}
---
title: Purple
layout: page
img: webjeda-purple-jekyll-theme.jpg
description: Webjeda Purple is a minimal theme built on default jekyll theme. It is very light highly customizable. Suitable for minimal blogs.
link: http://webjeda.com/purple/
---

# Features

## Customizable theme
The theme can be customized just by changing few variables in **_config.yml** file.

## Lightweight
Since the theme is based on default Jekyll theme, it is very lightweight. No JavaScript except analytics is used!

[**Preview**]({{page.link}})

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

You can provide any layout you prefer. I'm providing some more data in the YAML front matter since I need them. This one is for the **Purple** theme. Here is another one for the **Thunder** theme.


{% highlight yml %}{% raw %}
---
title: Thunder
layout: page
img: thunder-jekyll-theme.png
description: Thunder is a lightning fast responsive theme based on default Jekyll theme. It is minimal and free from JavaScript. It has a css file of size 5kb. This theme is best suited for minimal blogs. 
link: http://webjeda.com/thunder/
---

# Features

## Customizable theme
The theme can be customized just by changing few variables in **_config.yml** file.

## Inline CSS
Since the style used in this theme is very less, I'm inlining it. This will save a request and hence speeds up website loading.

## Light-weight
Since the theme is based on default Jekyll theme, it is very light-weight. No JavaScript except analytics is used!

[**Demo**]({{page.link}})

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

{% include adsense-inside-post.html %}


## Jekyll collection index

So I have two themes in my Theme collection. How to show them on a page? we have to create an index file. Create a file with them name **themes.md** in the root. 

{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
{% for themes in site.themes %}


<a href="{{ themes.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
        <h2>{{ themes.title }}</h2>
</a>

<p class="post-excerpt">{{ themes.description | truncate: 160 }}</p>

{% endfor %}      
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

Above liquid syntax will find all the theme files inside **_themes** folder and list them out along with their title and description. I have also included images in my theme collection using {{page.image}}. For simplicity, I haven't included it here. This will render a theme list like this.
<div style="border: 1px solid #aaa">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 639.007 213.476" >

By clicking on one of them will open up the theme file we created in the beginning. which will look something like this
<div style="border: 1px solid #aaa">

</div>

This is how Jekyll Collections are made. For a real example, take a look my **Themes** section.

Jekyll collections index page: [**Themes**](/jekyll-themes/){:target="_blank"}

An individual item from the collection: [**Thunder**](/jekyll-themes/thunder/){:target="_blank"}


## Conclusion
Try to fit in any content into a post or a page first. If they don't fit in, then think of using collections. Many times a simple list would do the job. Compare your Jekyll blog to a grocery store where things can be segregated into different collections. A collection of fruits, a collection of veggies, collections of beverages etc. Do not create collections for subsets, for example, say exotic fruits. They come under the fruit collection. In such cases use **categories**.
