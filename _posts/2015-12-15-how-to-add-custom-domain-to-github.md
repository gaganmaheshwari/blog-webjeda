## Why should we use a custom domain?
{: .clear }

Having a third-party domain like ```username.github.io``` is fine. But having a unique domain name adds credibility to your product or service. It is also important for SEO. Search engines always a domain name rather a free subdomain obtained from a third-party website. So buy a domain name, it doesn't cost much and it can help you build a brand in the long run.

I own 12 domains by the time of writing this article. If you have a good domain name in hand, you can always sell it to somebody who wants it. Maybe you can recover more than what you have spent on it.

Adding a custom domain to a GitHub hosted website is fairly easy . I will explain in simple steps, how to add a custom domain name to Github Pages website.

You may have a website hosted on Github Pages which has a URL that looks similar to ```http://sharu725.github.io/index.html```. But what you want is something like ```http://webjeda.com```. So how perform this change?

## Prerequisites

### A website hosted on Github Pages
Creating a website or uploading a pre-built website to github pages has become very easy after GIthub released drag and drop upload option to its repositories.

If you do not have a website yet, then refer to my post on [How to create a website and host it on github pages](http://blog.webjeda.com/how-to-create-and-host-a-website-on-github-pages/){:target="_blank"} to learn how you can create a simple website on Github Pages.

### A domain bought from any registrar
You have to purchase a domain from any registrar like GoDaddy, NamesCheap etc. It would cost you around $10 a year by the time this article being written.

Choose a short, easy-to-remember domain which may not have a number in it. A unique name is a good candidate for better ranking.

It is a good idea to stay away from dictionary words because almost all of them are either taken or hard to rank in search engines. Once you have purchased a domain name, go on to the next steps.


I have a website to which I want to configure custom domain using GitHub. It is accessible through this [link](https://github.com/Redgadget/test/blob/master/index.html){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"}. Keep this [test repository](https://github.com/Redgadget/test){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"} open because I will be discussing other aspects of the repository.

The website looks like this

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <title>
    First website
  </title>
  
  <body>
    <h1>This is my first github page</h1>
  </body>
  
  <style>
    body {
      background-color:green;
      color:#fff;
      text-align:center;
    }
  </style>
  
</html>
{% endhighlight %}



This is a test website that has nothing but a heading and background color. Since I thought of making this tutorial as simple as possible, I have kept the website to a bare minimum.


I own ``truejewels.in``. I will be using this domain for the test website whose current URL is ``http://redgadget.github.io/test/``. I have already configured custom domain which you can access using this link: [**truejewels.com**](http://truejewels.com){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"}

Let's see how I did it.

## Step 1: Adding CNAME file to the gh-pages branch.

![Adding a CNAME file to github screenshot]({{ site.url }}/images/adding-CNAME-file-to-github-repository.JPG "Adding a CNAME file to github screenshot")
{: .right .small}

Go to the repository where you have hosted your website and click on **New File**. You will see a blank space where you can type in anything. Name the file as **CNAME** without any extension.

Here is my repository for reference: [sample Repository](https://github.com/Redgadget/test){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"}

<p class="clear"></p>

![Adding domain name in CNAME file - github screenshot]({{ site.url }}/images/adding-domain-name-in-CNAME-file-github.JPG "Adding domain name in CNAME file - github screenshot")
{: .left .small}

Now, inside the CNAME file write your domain name you want to use(that you already own). I have written ``` truejewls.in ``` because that is what I will be using. Commit your file to the repository. Make sure you are still in the gh-pages branch while hitting commit.

{% include adsense-inside-post.html %}

## Step 2: Adding A record in the DNS Zone Records


Login to the website where you purchased your domain name (Domain Name Registrar). Mine is GoDaddy, but I think the procedure is similar to other registrars as well. 

Go to your domain and click on something similar to **Manage Domain**

![Adding A record to DNS Zone Records - github screenshot]({{ site.url }}/images/Adding-A-record-to-DNS-github.JPG "Adding A record to DNS Zone Records - github screenshot")



![Adding A record to DNS Zone Records - github screenshot]({{ site.url }}/images/Adding-A-record-to-DNS-github-2.JPG "Adding A record to DNS Zone Records - github screenshot")
{: .right .half}

Now, go to **DNS Zone File** option. This is where all your records reside. Click on **Add Record** and add an **A** record with the following configuration

**Host:** @


**Points to:** ``192.30.252.153`` or ``192.30.252.154``

These IPs belong to Github using which your website will be served on your domain name. They will not change anytime soon (at least that's what I believe). If that is the case then many websites hosted using Github Pages will go down all of a sudden.
You can find these IPs [here](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"}. You can use any or both of them . I guess there are two IPs for redundancy. For 100% availability, use both. In order to use both IPs, you have to add another **A** record with the second IP address.
{: .clear}

![Adding A record to DNS Zone Records - github screenshot]({{ site.url }}/images/Adding-A-record-to-DNS-github-3.JPG "Adding A record to DNS Zone Records - github screenshot")
{: .left .half}

Click on **Finish** and **Save**.

## Step 3: Waiting!
{: .clear}
And that's about it. You have successfully set up a custom domain for a github website. But do not rush. It will take a while to propagate. 

Propagation can take a long time and it can be at different speeds in different geo-locations. So try using a [proxy site](https://www.proxysite.com/){:rel='nofollow'} to see if it has propagated in different countries. Try servers from different countries.

A better option is to grab a cup of coffee :coffee:. Once you are done, hit the URL.

<div class="warning">
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>If your website has external <strong>css</strong> and <strong>js</strong> files, then watch out for the links you have used in the head tag. Make sure it links to proper files.</p>

Here is a video demonstration

Let me know if you were successful in using a custom domain name. Put your link in the comment section.
